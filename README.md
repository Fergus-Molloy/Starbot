# Starbot
A simple starbot for discord servers that have run out of pins.

## Setup
1. Create a channel for the starred messages to go in. I recomed that you setup the starboard channel so that only the bot can post in it
2. Set which role can change the starboard id and limit using ?set_mod_role "<str>"(can only be done by an admin)
3. Set the channel id using ?set_starboard <int>
4. Set the number of stars required to get on the starboard using ?set_limit <int>
